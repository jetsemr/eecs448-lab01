Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life...
One ring to rule them all. ... Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone.
There was a hobbit in the shire.
